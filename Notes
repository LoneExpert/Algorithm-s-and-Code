1. To swap two number we can use XOR operator
    a=5
    b=6
    a = a^b
    b = a^b
    a = a^b

2. b.erase(remove(b.begin(),b.end(),'0'),b.end());

3. Total sub array can be formed is-: n*(n+1)/2; with repeated element

3. to convert a string into number by left shifting the numbers 
    curr = curr*10+s[i]-'0'; in for loop
    curr = curr*10+s[i++]-'0'; in while loop or some other

4.  pq.push({-it.second,it.first}); 
    // basically -sign make this max heap behave like a min heap

5.  sort(v.begin(),v.end(),cmp);    

    bool cmp(pair<int,int>a,pair<int,int>b){
        return a.second < b.second; //  in ascedning order 
        // second because we need end time 
    }

    this is an custom operator used in greedy aproach.. 
    sorting based on end time .. (N meetings room *GFG*)

6. In coding, finding the GCD is a common problem, and there are various algorithms to compute it efficiently. Some well-known algorithms for finding the GCD include:

    1. Euclidean Algorithm: It is an efficient method based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers is the same as the GCD of the smaller number and the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number.

    2. Binary Euclidean Algorithm: A variation of the Euclidean algorithm that uses binary arithmetic for faster computation.

    3. Stein Algorithm: Also known as the binary GCD algorithm, it is an efficient algorithm that uses bitwise operations.

7. When u want to change back to ur usrname or email use this command in git
    git config --global user.name "<username>"
    git config --global user.email "<email>"
    git config --global user.name
        <username>
    git config --global user.email
        <email>
    git credential-cache exit
        -- to roll back thet crendential that is active
    git remote set-url origin "<link of your github repository>"
        -- used to set the repository link 
    git branch -M <branch name>
        -- to go <branch name> branch
