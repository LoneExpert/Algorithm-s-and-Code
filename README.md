Algorithm and Code...

Welcome to the Algorithm and Code repository!!!
This repository contains a collection of solved problems and implementations of various algorithms across a range of topics. 
The aim of this repository is to serve as a resource for learning, practicing, and mastering different algorithmic techniques.



The repository covers the following topics:

1. Trees
2. Linked Lists
3. Subsequences
4. Recursion
5. Sorting Algorithm
6. Spoj
7. String
8. Array
9. Permutation
10. Heap
11. Hashmap
12. Graphs
13. Dynamic Programming (DP)
14. Bit Manupulation
15. many more...



    HOW TO USE  
  
    1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/Algorithm-and-Code.git
    2. Navigate to the desired topic folder: cd Algorithm-and-Code/Trees (for example)
    3. Explore the solutions and implementations:
         a. Each file is named after the problem or algorithm it solves.
         b. Read the code comments and documentation within each file for detailed explanations.
    5. Compile and run the solutions:
         a. Most of the solutions are written in C++.
         b. Use a C++ compiler to compile and run the code.
